## Vision-based-Steatosis-Assessment-in-Liver-Transplants-using-Transformer-for-NASH-Classification

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a type of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterised by inflammation and damage due to the accumulation of fat in the liver. NASH can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure, making liver transplantation a critical treatment option for advanced cases. A major challenge in liver transplantation is the accurate assessment of hepatic steatosis, as both macro- and microvesicular steatosis significantly impact the viability of liver grafts. This project introduces ViSASH, a novel method that uses the Vision Transformers (ViTs) for the automatic classification of NASH in liver transplantations.
